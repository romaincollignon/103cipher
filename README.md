## :rocket: Introduction

    Cryptography is a very old science, whose goal is to secure communication, so
    that only its recipient could read it.
    There are a lot of methods to encrypt a message, from the simplest (such as the
    2,000-year-old Caesar cipher) to the most complex (such as the World War 2
    Enigma code); they all need both encryption and decryption keys (sometimes
    identical).
